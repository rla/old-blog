Core Spring AOP interfaces, built on AOP Alliance AOP interoperability interfaces.

<br>Any AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor is usable in Spring.

<br>Spring AOP also offers:
<ul>
	<li>Introduction support
	<li>A Pointcut abstraction, supporting "static" pointcuts
		(class and method-based) and "dynamic" pointcuts (also considering method arguments).
		There are currently no AOP Alliance interfaces for pointcuts.
	<li>A full range of advice types, including around, before, after returning and throws advice.
	<li>Extensibility allowing arbitrary custom advice types to
		be plugged in without modifying the core framework.
</ul>

<br>
Spring AOP can be used programmatically or (preferably)
integrated with the Spring IoC container.
