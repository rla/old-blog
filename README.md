=======

My old blog engine. Written in Java in somewhere 2008-2009. Uses [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) 1.4,
[OpenJPA](http://openjpa.apache.org/) and [OsCache](http://java.net/projects/oscache). Dumping it to Github for archival reasons.

My new blog engine is [here](https://github.com/rla/blog).
